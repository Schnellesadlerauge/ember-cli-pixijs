# ember-cli-pixijs

ember-cli-pixijs wraps the [pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) HTML5
2D rendering engine so that it can easily be used in Ember.js applications:

```js
import PIXI from 'pixi';
```

It also defines a `PixiCanvas` component that can be used to display canvases
rendered with pixi.js in Ember.js applications. The component handles creating
a pixi.js renderer, inserting the canvas into the DOM and replacing it when the
dimensions change. Whenever the canvas is (re-)rendered, the component's `draw`
method is called that handles the actual drawing with pixi.js.

A concrete subclass of the `PixiCanvas` component might look sth. like this:

```js
// app/components/my-pixi-component.js
import PIXI from 'pixi';
import PixiCanvas from 'ember-cli-pixijs/components/pixi-canvas';

export default PixiCanvas.extend({
  draw() {
    const renderer = this.get('pixiRenderer');
    const stage = new PIXI.Container();

    const graphics = new PIXI.Graphics();

    // set a fill and line style
    graphics.beginFill(0xFF3300);
    graphics.lineStyle(10, 0xffd900, 1);

    // draw a shape
    graphics.moveTo(50, 50);
    graphics.lineTo(250, 50);
    graphics.lineTo(100, 100);
    graphics.lineTo(250, 220);
    graphics.lineTo(50, 220);
    graphics.lineTo(50, 50);
    graphics.endFill();

    stage.addChild(graphics);
    
    renderer.render(stage);
  }
});
```
